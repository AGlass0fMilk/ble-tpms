     * Class representing a TPMS packet parsed from manufacturer's payload
     *
     * A few observations:
     *
     * - The last 3 octets MAC address of the TPMS sensors is printed w/ a barcode onto stickers for scanning with the mobile app
     * - The 3rd-to-last octet is always "10", "20", "30", or "40" and indicate the "wheel number" from the set it came in
     * - It may be possible to have other values in this location if the set came with more than 4 sensors
     *
     * Manufacturer packet format as reverse-engineered from Android app decompilation:
     * Bytes 0-1: Likely protocol version or manufacturer ID. App checks to make sure it is "0x0001" before parsing the rest
     * Byte 2: Tire prefix, valid values appear to be 0x80 (tire 1) to 0x83 (tire 4), also first octet of MAC address
     * Bytes 3-7: The rest of the MAC address
     * Bytes 8-11: Unsigned 32-bit tire pressure value in pascals
     * Bytes 12-15: Signed(?) 32-bit tire temperature value in Celsius (0.01C precision)
     * Byte 16: Battery voltage encoded in a really weird format
     * Byte 17: Appears to change from 0x00 to 0x01 depending on if it's "on tire" (0) or "off tire" (1), maybe an alert flag?
     *
     * Battery Voltage Decoding (based on reverse engineering app):
     * The Battery Voltage Byte (BVB) appears to be decoded using a piece-wise function as follows:
     *
     * 0 < BVB <= 4:     Voltage = (((((BVB << 16)/4*224 >> 16 + 1136) / 2) / 1023) * 3.6)
     * 5 <= BVB <= 28):  Voltage = (((((((BVB - 4) << 16) / 24) * 224) >> 16) + 1360) / 2) / 1023 * 3.6
     * 29 <= BVB <= 100: Voltage = (((((((BVB - 28) << 16) / 72) * 121) >> 16) + 1584) / 2) / 1023 * 3.6
     *
